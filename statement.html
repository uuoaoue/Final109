            Pac-Man is a 1980 maze action video game developed and released for arcades. For more than 40 years, Pacman has become a classic gameplay for everyone. Although it is a simple concept game, it is really engaging and exciting to play.
  
            My idea is to make the original arcade game into a computer game so that I can create my own maze map. The game is to celebrate the end of the hard-working semester for everyone.
            <br><br><u>How to play:</u>
            <br>
            Using the arrows to move Pacman.<br> Pacman mission is to eat all the yellow dots and avoid the ghosts.<br>
            When Pacman eats the flashing power dots, the host will turn blue. Pacman can eat the blue ghosts. <br>
            When Pacman eats all the dots, you win.
            When Pacman hit the pink ghosts, you lose.<br><br>
